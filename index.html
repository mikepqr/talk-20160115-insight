# Advice about advice

 - Data science is a young discipline, so
   - people who've being doing it for long enough to be experienced are unusual
   in many ways
   - the people with CVs more like yours don't have much experience
--

 - What kind of 'data scientist' are you talking to?
--

   - A business analytics person
   - A data engineering person
   - A software engineer who taught themself statistics
   - A science PhD who taught themself to code
   - A quasi-academic with a PhD in machine learning who got hired at NIPS

---

# Me

Academia

 - Undergrad physics ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
 - PhD astrophysics ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
 - 2 years at postdoc 1 ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
 - 1 year at postdoc 2 ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

--

Left academia summer 2014 ðŸŽ‰

--

Not academia

 - 1 year at Brandwatch as a 'Data Scientist'
 - At Fast Forward Labs as a 'Research Engineer' since October 2015

# Choosing a job

[Advice from Stitchfix](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/advice-for-data-scientists/)

> A Data Scientist should look for a company that actually uses data science to
> set themselves apart from the competition. When this happens, the company
> becomes supportive to data science instead of the other way around. It's
> willing to invest in acquiring the top talent, building the necessary
> infrastructure, pioneering the latest algorithmic and computational techniques,
> and building incredible engineering products to manifest the data science. 
--


> **"Good enough" is not a phrase that is uttered in the context of a strategic
> differentiator**.

# Comparison to academia

 - The visa situation is much tougher
 - Self promotion is still important. Don't stop giving talks!
 - Changing jobs is easier and more common
--

 - Your career options increase, and not everything has an application form. This is exciting and overwhelming. You'll get the hang of it.

# Brandwatch

# Fast Forward Labs

 - Each quarter we profile a new development in computer science, statistics or
 machine learning
 - We build a prototype and write a report

# Neural networks

 - Logistic regression learns a mapping from features X1..XN to a classification y
 - Can only learn linear relationships, unless you add cross terms X1 X2, etc.
 - Feed-forward neural networks learn the cross terms that are useful

# Recurrent neural networks

 - Feed forward neural networks (including convolutional neural networks) cannot
   - take variable length sequences as input
   - remember
 - These are show-stoppers for most language tasks
 - Recurrent neural networks solve this

# Not as scary as they seem!

.column[

- Difficult to intuit about structure and interpret results, which can be a show stopper
- A fast moving subject, which means you still have to keep an eye on arXiv ðŸ˜ž
- Computationally expensive (sometimes)
- Powerful, which can be the difference between accomplishing a task and not
- Robust, flexible and composable

# Technical skills you may not have picked up in academia

 - Algorithms and data structures
   - Big-Oh notation, i.e. how bad is this `for` loop?
   - Graphs
 - NLP and text
 - Bayesian inferrence/probabilistic programming
 - Engineering-grade code
 - AWS
 - Java and the JVM
   - So you can talk to your colleagues in engineering
   - For Scala/spark, etc.
 - Frontend
